# Nuclio JavaScript Class Exercises
This project contains multiple JavaScript exercises that will guide you through key concepts in JavaScript, helping you understand how to manipulate arrays, objects, and other JavaScript data types. Each exercise is designed to challenge you to solve a specific problem, and all tests are provided to validate your solution.

## How to Run the Project
To get started with the exercises:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd js-advance-class-exercises
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Run a specific exercise**:
   ```bash
   npm test -- 01
   ```

Each exercise is structured as a separate folder, and running `npm test` will execute the tests for all exercises. Your goal is to modify the JavaScript files to pass all the tests.

## Exercises Overview

Here is an overview of the topics covered:

- **Arrays**:
    - Manipulating array elements (add, remove, find, filter)
    - Sorting and reversing arrays
    - Concatenating and joining arrays

- **Objects**:
    - Creating and modifying objects
    - Accessing object properties
    - Adding new properties to objects

Each exercise has a dedicated folder containing:
- A `exercise.js` file where you need to write your solution.
- A `exercise.spec.js` file that contains the tests for that exercise.
- A `README.md` file that provides instructions and hints for each exercise.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:
- **JavaScript** (ES6+ features)
- **Node.js** and **npm** for managing dependencies and running tests
- **Jest** for unit testing to verify your solutions
